# Basic-Library
A basic website to test beginner knowledge of Javascript Object Oriented Programming


I used various tutorials and resources, most importantly i used the meyer reset, https://michalosman.github.io/library/ code 
and https://codepen.io/nodws/pen/VwpbeX tutorial.

I analyzed how Michalosman  javascript worked to create a new Book card in the DOM.
